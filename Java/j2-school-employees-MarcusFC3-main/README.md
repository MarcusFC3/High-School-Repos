# School Employees
 
### Instructions

Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. 

- A person has a name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 
- A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior).
- An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use a Java Date object for date hired. 
- A faculty member has office hours and a rank. 
- A staff member has a title. 

Override the toString method in each class to display each of the fields in a friendly format.

Write a test program that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff. Store each of them in a single ArrayList. Use a loop to invoke each of their toString() methods and print them to the console.

Insert a comment at the top of the code containing your name, the chapter number, lab number and the date the program was created.
