# StringParsing
### Instructions:
 - Write a program that prompts the user to enter in their name. Retrieve the data as a
single string, parse it and determine if the name was entered in as “First Last” or “Last,
First”. If the name was entered in as “Last, First” print it out as shown. If the name
was entered in as “First Last” modify it to be “Last, First” and print it out.
 - Insert a comment at the top of the code containing your name, the chapter number, lab
number and the date the program was created. These comments must exist in all
programs you submit for this class.
