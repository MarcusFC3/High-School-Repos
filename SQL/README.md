# SQL Assignments

Use this repo to store your SQL homework assignments each week.

The main folder contains a series of .sql files named in this format: *sql-lesson-N.sql*. You will edit the appropriate file each week adding answers to vocabulary and homework questions. Note that the answer to most questions should be a SQL statement that will generate the appropriate answer to the question. Don't answer the question directly!

The Lessons folder contains the weekly materials for each lesson.

Place any other materials that you wish to track in the 'Other' folder.  
e.g. notes, SQL examples, class demos...
