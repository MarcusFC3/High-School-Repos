# List Name Search

The root folder of this project contains two files.
- GirlsNames.txt – The top 200 girl names from 2000-2009  
- BoysNames.txt – The top 200 boy names from 2000-2009  


Create an application that reads the contents of the two files into two separate lists. 
The user should be able to enter a name into the text box on the form. 
When the search button is pressed the form should display if the name was found in either 
or both lists (or neither) and the position in each list where it was found. 
Use full sentences in displaying the results to the user.

Note: Remember that humans count from one, programmers count from zero! Take that into consideration when reporting the position to the user.
