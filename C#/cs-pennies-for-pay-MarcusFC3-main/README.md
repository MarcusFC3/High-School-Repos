# Pennies For Pay

Susan is hired for a job, and her employer agrees to pay her every day. Her employer
also agrees that Susan's salary is 1 penny for the first day, 2 pennies for the second day,
4 pennies for the third day, and will continue to double each day she works.


Code the application to display each day and the amount of pay for that day using a loop.
Add each day number and the amount of daily pay to the listbox provided. Remember that you 
can use \t (inside quotes) to insert tabs to keep your information in neat columns.


After the loop completes add one more item to the listbox showing the total income for the 
number of days that Susan worked.


Make sure to use format codes for currency!
