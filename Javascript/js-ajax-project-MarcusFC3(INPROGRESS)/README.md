# AJAX Project

This assignment will be your chance to show off everything you have learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
requirements below are minimums. You should make the best site you can using techniques and features that have been
discussed in the course. Only doing the minimum base tasks would earn an average grade. More style and substance earns
higher marks.

### Requirements

Design a well-structured page with a coherant theme around the subject of your page. (For example: Cars)  
Use external CSS and JavaScript files.

Select an API that will respond in JSON format with multiple images realated to your theme. You can use any (school-appropriate) API on the Internet as long as access won't be restricted for grading, i.e. It has to run for the instructor.  

Preload the images into some type of appropriate data structure and use them in a JQuery-based carousel that allows the user
to browse through the images with forward and back buttons. You could additionally use a timer to advance the images automatically. There should also be text-based elements that are updated with things like titles and/or captions for the images.

- Navigation
- Input Validation
