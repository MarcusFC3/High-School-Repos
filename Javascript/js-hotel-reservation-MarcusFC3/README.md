### Instructions
- Run the application and click the Submit Request button to see the page that’s displayed when the form is submitted to the server.
- In the JavaScript file, note that the ready event handler contains the declaration for a constant named emailPattern that contains the pattern that will be used to validate the email address.
- Code a statement that moves the focus to the “Arrival date” text box.
- Code an event handler for the submit event of the form. 
  - This event handler should validate the user entries. 
  - If any of the entries are invalid, the code should cancel the submission of the form.
