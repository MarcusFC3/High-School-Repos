## Future Value

This application calculates the future value of an investment. It starts by using prompt statements to get the investment amount, interest rate, and number of years from the user. These prompts are coded within do-while loops that are executed until the user enters a numeric value. Next, a for loop uses the entries to calculate the future value of the investment. After the loop, it the application displayes the values entered along with the calculated future value.
