# Improved Temperature Converter

In this exercise, you’ll add data validation to the application you created in extra exercise 2-1. You’ll also let the user do multiple conversions before ending the application. This is the dialog box for an invalid entry:

### Instructions
- Correct any issues from last week
- Copy the convert_temps.html from last week into this repo
- Add data validation to the application so it won’t do the conversion until the user enters a Fahrenheit temperature between -100 and 212. If the entry is invalid, a dialog box like the one above should be displayed.
- Add a loop to the code so the user can do a series of calculations without restarting the application. To end the application, the user must enter 999 as the temperature.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Correcting issues from the previous assignment
- File management - Copying files to this repo
- Data Validation
- Selection and use of a loop
- Formating, comments, whitespace, etc..
